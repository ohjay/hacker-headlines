...but maybe not the news you need.

Hacker Headlines is a Chrome extension that periodically checks [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) for the latest and greatest updates on the world of computer science. If it finds something that readers have deemed acceptably newsworthy, a notification containing the headline and link will be displayed in the corner of your browser window. 

That means you don't need to spend every other minute checking the site for distractions.<sup>1</sup> And in the meantime, you can learn new things without even trying. Isn't that great?
