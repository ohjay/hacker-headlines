# hacker-headlines
Hacker Headlines is a Chrome extension that periodically checks [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) for the latest and greatest updates on the world of computer science. If it finds something that readers have deemed acceptably newsworthy, a notification containing the headline and link will be displayed in the corner of your browser window. 

This way, you don't need to spend every other minute checking the website for distractions.<sup>1</sup> And in the meantime, you can learn new things without even trying. Yay!

***
<sup>1</sup> Instead, the distractions will come to you (...but in a controlled setting!)
